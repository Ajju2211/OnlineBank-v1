# OnlineBank-v1
This was my first small one file project more than 2000 lines bcoz I was learning java in the starting stage only at that time I don't know much about database so I used file system to save the data.

Its all funny whose gonna use filestorage for the banking application everyone will use database right but I don't know anything about github,database.Bcoz it
was my first application in the 2nd sem at that time java was teaching in our college so while learning I used to code that application.


I have added all the bank features you can find the video link here.

Install java sdk and
Just change the email and password in the Mail.send line and use it.
